            <h2>Haworthias</h2>
            <p>Succulents that can grow in medium light, unlike most that need lots of bright light.</p>
            <img src="Images/Haw-1.jpg" alt="Two haworthias. One is in a flower shape and has stripes of variegation, the other looks like a geometrical mound of forbidden green grapes." height="420"/>
            <p>Their translucent windows let the light in, allowing them to live in lower light than most other succulents. Also makes you want to take a bite. </p>
            <p>This one had babies:</p>
            <img src="Images/Haw-2.jpg" alt="A big haworthia with many smaller ones around it." height="420"/>
            <p>I'm still figuring out how to keep them so they will stop JETTISONING THEIR ROOTS OFF, but they're hardy plants and that will give me time to figure it out.</p>
            <img src="Images/Haw-3.jpg" alt="Rude haworthias that have only tiny baby roots left." height="420"/>
            <p>Rude.</p>

            <h2>Purple Passion Plant</h2>
            <p>An adorable green plant with purple fuzzies! They like to stay moist, and will droop their leaves when they need more water. Very good if you're forgetful!</p>
            <img src="Images/Purple-Passion.jpg" height="420" alt="Purple fuzzy plants. One is tipped over and has cutting taken from it."/>
            <p>These plants started out about the same size, then I repotted one in a bigger pot, and it grew very fast. I took a few cuttings from the top to hopefully help it stop lengthening so quickly and focus on growing a little bushier</p>

            <h2>Pilea Glauca</h2>
            <p>Very cute tiny leaves, it's growing some long trailing limbs. My least problematic plant.</p>

            <h2>Hoya Krohniana "Black Leaves"</h2>
            <p>I've wanted a black houseplant for a while now, so I was very happy to get this little cutting. It's supposed to darken in higer light, but can tolerate lower light.</p>
            <img src="Images/Hoya-Black.jpg" height="420" alt="A small black and green plant, with a tiny black leaf growing out of it"/>
            <p>It's not pure black, but a mix of black and green. The teeny new leaf started out lime green, but has darkened a lot in the sun.</p>

            <h2>The Quarantine Zone</h2>
            <p>Where new plants go for a few weeks to make sure I'm not introducing pests to my collection.</p>
            <p>I've been trying to stick to cuttings for new purchases, since they're both easier to check over for pests, and easier on my wallet.</p>

               <h3>Callisia Repens Pink Lady</h3>
               <p>Like Tradenscentia Zebrina, but pink, white, and green, and also tiny.</p>
               <p>A bit of this fell off a plant at a nursery and they said I could keep it. It's separated into 3 teeny plants, and stuck in soil. Who will live and who will die is a mystery, but it's probably going to be the one on the bottom right if any.</p>

               <h3>Hoya Heuschkeiliana Variegated</h3>
               <p>Extremely pretty, new growth starts out pink and then fades into the normal white/green.</p>
               <p>It got ROOT ROT when I tried to transfer it from sphagnum moss to coco husk. >:( Now I have to re-root it and hope this doesn't happen again.</p>
